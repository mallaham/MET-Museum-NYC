# The Metropolitan Museum of Art Dataset

I came across this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/metmuseum/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-open-access) on Kaggle describing the different types of artwork being displayed at The MET in NYC. 

Below are some of the questions I was interested in answering:

- Where the artworks displayed at the MET are coming from?
- Which artists is the MET interested in?
- Which department hosts the largest number of artworks?
